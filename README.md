[![FINOS - Active](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/finos/contrib-toolbox@master/images/badge-active.svg)](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FINOS/Active)

## What is DevOps Mutualization?
DevOps Mutualization aims to solve common engineering problems by providing a continuous compliance and assurance approach to DevOps that mutually benefits banks, auditors and regulators whilst accelerating DevOps adoption in engineering and fintech IT departments.

## What is the initial objective of DevOps Mutualization?
To initially unite SMEs from across FINOS members including Engineering, IT, Compliance, Security, Audit, etc. to identify 2-3 specific areas/projects where collaborative, open source, development could improve DevOps for FINOS members.

## How to contribute to DevOps Mutualization 
Add your DevOps problems, or the opportunities you see in this area, to the [DevOps Mutualization GitHub Issues](https://github.com/finos-labs/devops-mutualization/issues) or by emailing james.mcleod@finos.org 

## Using DCO to sign your commits
All commits into DevOps Mutualization must be signed with a DCO signature to avoid being flagged by the DCO Bot. This means that your commit log message must contain a line that looks like the following one, with your actual name and email address:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

Adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` will add that line automatically. You can also add it manually as part of your commit log message or add it afterwards with `git commit --amend -s`.
