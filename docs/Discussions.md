## DevOps Mutualization SIG Discussions

DevOps Mutualization SIG uses [Github Team Discussions](https://odp.finos.org/docs/project-collaboration#github-team-discussions) 
that are only visible to members who are part of the [devops-mutualization-participants team](https://github.com/orgs/finos/teams/devops-mutualization-participants/) -
as agreed upon in the [meeting on Feb 18th 2020](https://github.com/finos/devops-mutualization/issues/18).

Discussions augment the use of Issues in this repository for public discussions.
